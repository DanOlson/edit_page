Upon installing edit_page, you'll need to connect your application to the engine through routes.
To do this, simply open config/routes.rb in your app and paste in this line:
mount EditPage::Engine => "/edit_page"

You may, of course, change '/edit_page' to a route of your choice. For example:
mount EditPage::Engine => "/my_pages"

You'll need to create this file structure in your app: /lib/edit_page/pages
and place any pages you'd like to be editable in that directory.
For example /lib/edit_page/pages/about.html where 'about.html' is a page you'd like to be editable

Next, you'll need to copy edit_page's migrations like this:
rake edit_page:install:migrations

Then you'll be able to run:
rake db:migrate
to run edit_page's migrations, which will handle importing your editable page content.

In your app's pages controller, something like this:

class PagesController < ApplicationController
  def show
    @page = EditPage::Page.find_by_title(params[:title])
  end
end

And in your view:
<%= @page.content %>

And, of course, routes:
match 'pages/:title' => 'pages#show'
