Upon installing edit_page, you'll need to connect your application to the engine through routes.
To do this, simply open config/routes.rb in your app and paste in this line:
mount EditPage::Engine => "/edit_page"

You may, of course, change '/edit_page' to a route of your choice. For example:
mount EditPage::Engine => "/my_pages"


You'll also need to copy edit_page's migrations like this:
rake edit_page:install:migrations

Then you'll be able to run:
rake db:migrate
to run edit_page's migrations.
